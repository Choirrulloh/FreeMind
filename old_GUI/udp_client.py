# This code is probably good for Python 2. But in Python 3, this will cause an issue, something related to bit encoding. I was trying to make a simple TCP server and encountered the same problem. Encoding worked for me. Try this with sendto command.

# Similarly you would use .decode() to receive the data on the UDP server
# side, if you want to print it exactly as it was sent.
